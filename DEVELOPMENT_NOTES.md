## Current Status
- Basic game mechanics implemented
- Pseudo-3D rendering working
- Player car controls and physics
- Obstacle generation and collision detection
- HUD with speed, score, and distance

## To-Do List
- Add sound effects and background music

## Notes on Implementation
The game uses a pseudo-3D rendering technique similar to classic racing games from the 90s. This involves:
- Projecting 3D coordinates onto a 2D screen
- Using scaling to create the illusion of depth
- Drawing road segments from back to front
- Applying perspective to objects based on distance
