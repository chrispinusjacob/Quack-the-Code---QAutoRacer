# Educational Notes for QAutoRacer

## Pseudo-3D Rendering Techniques
This game demonstrates classic pseudo-3D rendering techniques used in racing games from the 80s and 90s before true 3D acceleration was widely available. Key concepts include:

1. **Projection Mathematics**: Converting 3D world coordinates to 2D screen coordinates using perspective projection.
2. **Depth Scaling**: Objects further away appear smaller based on their Z-distance from the camera.
3. **Segment-Based Rendering**: The road is drawn as a series of trapezoids that create the illusion of a 3D road.
4. **Parallax Scrolling**: Background elements move at different speeds based on their perceived distance.

## Physics Simulation
The game implements simplified physics for car handling:

1. **Acceleration and Deceleration**: Gradual speed changes with natural deceleration.
2. **Centrifugal Force**: Cars are pulled to the outside of curves based on speed.
3. **Steering Sensitivity**: Steering response varies based on the car's speed.

## Procedural Generation
The track is generated procedurally using:

1. **Curve Generation**: Mathematical functions to create smooth curves.
2. **Hill Generation**: Vertical displacement to create hills and valleys.
3. **Segment-Based Construction**: Building the track from individual segments.
4. **Randomized Parameters**: Using random values within constraints to create varied but playable tracks.

## Game Design Elements
Educational aspects of game design demonstrated:

1. **Progressive Difficulty**: The game becomes more challenging as the player advances.
2. **Visual Feedback**: Speed is communicated through visual effects like the road movement rate.
3. **HUD Design**: Important information is displayed clearly without obstructing gameplay.
4. **Risk/Reward Balance**: Players must balance speed (for higher scores) with safety (avoiding obstacles).

## Technical Implementation
Key programming concepts demonstrated:

1. **Game Loop**: The core update-render cycle that drives the game.
2. **Object-Oriented Design**: Using classes to represent game entities.
3. **State Management**: Handling different game states (title, playing, game over).
4. **Resource Management**: Loading and managing game assets.
5. **Input Handling**: Processing and responding to user input.
