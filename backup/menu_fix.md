# Menu System Troubleshooting Guide

If the buttons in your menu system aren't working properly, here are some fixes to try:

## 1. Button Class Fix

The issue might be with the alpha channel in the button glow effect. Replace your `button.py` file with the fixed version in `button_fix.py`:

```python
# In button_fix.py, the key change is:
# Instead of:
# pygame.draw.rect(surface, (*color[:3], 50), glow_rect, border_radius=5)

# We use:
glow_color = (color[0], color[1], color[2])
pygame.draw.rect(surface, glow_color, glow_rect, border_radius=5)
```

## 2. Test with Simple Menu

Run the `simple_menu_test.py` script to verify that basic button functionality works. This uses a simplified button class without the glow effects that might be causing issues.

## 3. Check Mouse Event Handling

Make sure your mouse events are being properly detected:

```python
# In your handle_events method:
mouse_pos = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
mouse_clicked = False

for event in events:
    if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN and event.button == 1:
        mouse_clicked = True
        print(f"Mouse clicked at: {mouse_pos}")  # Debug print
```

## 4. Verify Button Positions

Make sure your buttons are positioned correctly on the screen:

```python
# Add debug outlines to see button positions
for button in self.buttons.values():
    pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (255, 0, 0), button.rect, 1)  # Red outline
```

## 5. Check for Overlapping UI Elements

Make sure no other UI elements are overlapping your buttons and intercepting mouse clicks.

## 6. Pygame Version Compatibility

Some features like alpha blending and rounded rectangles might not work in older Pygame versions. Try updating Pygame:

```
pip install pygame --upgrade
```

## 7. Simplified Button Implementation

If all else fails, replace your Button class with the SimpleButton class from `simple_menu_test.py`, which uses a more basic implementation without advanced effects.

## 8. Run the Standalone Test

The `simple_menu_test.py` script provides a standalone test for button functionality. If buttons work in this script but not in your main game, the issue might be with how the menu is integrated into the game.
